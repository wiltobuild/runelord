## Run Score

Awarded for every completed run, win or lose. Shown on the run-history screen and used by the final-boss scene to render the "damage" numbers on the Architect.

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Rooms visited | 10 pts per room × act number (×1 / ×2 / ×3) |
| Gold gained | +1 pt per 100 gold (divided by player count) |
| Elites killed | +50 each (the elite you died to doesn't count) |
| Bosses slain | +100 per boss room you cleared (the boss you died to doesn't count) |
| Ascension multiplier | ×(1 + ascension × 0.1) |

> Final = (rooms + gold + elites + bosses) × (1 + ascension × 0.1). At A10 your score is doubled. Source: `ScoreUtility.CalculateScore`.

## Worked Example

Hypothetical A0 win — 15 rooms in act 1, 14 in act 2, 14 in act 3, 4 elites killed, 3 bosses, 1,200 gold gained, single player.

| Component | Math | Pts |
|-----------|------|----:|
| Act 1 rooms | 15 × 10 × 1 | 150 |
| Act 2 rooms | 14 × 10 × 2 | 280 |
| Act 3 rooms | 14 × 10 × 3 | 420 |
| Gold | 1200 / 100 | 12 |
| Elites | 4 × 50 | 200 |
| Bosses | 3 × 100 | 300 |
| **Subtotal × A0 multiplier** | 1,362 × 1.0 | **1,362** |

> The same run on A10 would multiply by 2.0 for a final score of 2,724. Each A-tier adds +10% — there's no diminishing return.

## Daily-Run Leaderboard Score

Daily runs use a completely separate scoring system that's a single packed integer. The digits ARE the sort order — a numeric DESC sort gives the right ranking, no separate columns needed. Major Update #1 introduced this so "the score sent to the leaderboards is based on whether you won, how many badges you accrued, and how quickly you finished the run (in that order)". That quote skips a step: the real sort order is victory, then floors visited, then badges, then time. The packed integer is `victory × 1e8 + floors × 1e6 + badges × 1e4 + (9999 − time)`, so floors outrank badges.

| Bucket | Multiplier | Range |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Victory flag | × 100,000,000 | 1 = loss, 2 = win |
| Floors visited | × 1,000,000 | 0–99 |
| Badges earned | × 10,000 | 0–99 |
| Run time | 9999 − seconds (clamped 0–9999) | faster = higher |

> Source: `ScoreUtility.CalculateDailyScore`. The matching `DecodeDailyScore` peels the integer back into `{ victory, floors, badges, runTime }` for display. The time term uses your time-to-win on a victory and your total run time on a loss, clamped to 0–9999 seconds before the `9999 − time` flip.

## Daily-Score Worked Example

An A10 daily win — 48 floors visited, 7 badges earned, completed in 1,842 seconds (30:42).

| Bucket | Math | Contribution |
|--------|------|-------------:|
| Victory (win) | 2 × 100,000,000 | 200,000,000 |
| Floors | 48 × 1,000,000 | 48,000,000 |
| Badges | 7 × 10,000 | 70,000 |
| Time | 9999 − 1842 | 8,157 |
| **Total packed score** | | **248,078,157** |

> Beat someone's 248,070,XXX score? You won, hit at least 48 floors, and got 7+ badges. Faster runs win at every tier of the comparison.

## Why Two Scores?

The **run score** is descriptive — it tells you how good a single run was at a glance, weighted heavily toward depth (act 3 rooms count 3x). The **daily score** is a sorting key — it has to compare two runs deterministically and produce one winner. Mega Crit packed it as a single integer so the leaderboard can be sorted with one column and no tiebreaker logic.

> The constant `clientScore = -999999999` is a sentinel for "this row was sent without a server-computed score" — used to filter unverified entries from the leaderboard view.
